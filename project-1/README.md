Project1-Make
=============

Jed Dunn  

Within my project-1 directory, I wasn't sure what to place in the .gitignore file. I just copied into this .gitignore file what was in the .gitignore file in the cns3060-dunnjed directory that I forked on github. This project was overall not very difficult. The hardest part for me was figuring out the differece between commit and push when using git, but I figured it out.
