I enjoyed doing this project overall. One tricky part was making sure to ignore the . and .. directories
so that I wouldn't end up traversing through them recursively forever. Another tricky part for me at
least was figuring out how to format the output so that the filenames were lined up correctly after the 
file and folder size output. I used the snprintf function, which I had never used before.
