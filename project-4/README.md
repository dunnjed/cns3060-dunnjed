Project4-Disk Scheduling
=============

Jed Dunn  

I liked that you gave us the option to write this program in any language that we wanted to. I chose C++ simply because I've 
never taken a class in C++ so I like to write programs in it whenever I get the chance so that I can continue to learn the 
language. I liked that you chose this assignment because it definitely helped me to understand more fully how these disk
scheduling algorithms work and why certain ones are better than others. You kind of get an idea of this from the slides,
but writing this program made those ideas much clearer and better to understand.
